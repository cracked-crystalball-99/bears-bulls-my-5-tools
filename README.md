# bears-bulls-my-5-tools

I have created a web app tool for simplifying traditional technial analysis.
The web app simplifies or reduces each tool to a pair of percentages.

After processing your closing price date for cryptos or stocks,
the web app presents percentages in the last table: Votes Innovative Percentages (VIP %).
For each of the up to 5 tools, you find there a pair of percentages.

The percentages represent cumulative calculations, indicating an opinion.
The left-side, coded in green, shows the buy or yes vote percentage. 
On the right-side, coded in red, shows the sell or no vote percentage.

You interpret the percentages as to persuasiveness.
